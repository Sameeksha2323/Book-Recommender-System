# Book-Recommender-System (Industry Implications)
This ML model can recommend a user upto 5 books to read based on his/her previous preferences. This model has huge implications in the domain of E-Commerce as 
it forms the backbone of the platforms that use audience's preferences and proximity to recommend them further desirable items, example for, Zepto, Myntra, Blinkit, Amazon, Snapdeal, Zomato, Swiggy, etc.

## Technology Used
It is based on Collaborative Filtering which further utilizes the techniques of clustering nearest neighbors to extract the top 5 closest books based on user's previous choice and taking into account databases with more than 27 lakh ratings, 4 lakh books, and 11K unique users. This model is a classic example of Unsupervised Learning and clustering. 

I have always enjoyed reading books and many times found myself lost while looking for my next read. Therefore, this idea was born!! :)
